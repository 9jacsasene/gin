## Download and Install Android Studio
 
The first step is to download and install Android Studio, if you don't have it already. Android Studio is a powerful IDE that provides code completion, debugging, testing, and emulation tools for Android app development. You can download it from [the official website](https://developer.android.com/studio/).[^2^]

After downloading the installer file, run it and follow the instructions to complete the installation. You can choose the default settings or customize them according to your preferences.
 
## Download the Android SDK R10
 
After installing and opening Android Studio, you need to download the Android SDK R10 as follows:
 
1. Click **Tools** > **SDK Manager**.
2. In the **SDK Platforms** tab, select **Android 10 (29)**.
3. In the **SDK Tools** tab, select **Android SDK Build-Tools 29** (or higher).
4. Click **OK** to begin the download and installation.

The SDK Manager will download and install the selected packages in your computer. You can check the progress and status in the bottom-right corner of the window.
 
## Update Your Build Configuration
 
To fully test your app's compatibility with Android 10 and begin using the APIs introduced in this version of the platform, you need to update your build configuration in your module-level `build.gradle` file as shown here:
  ```groovy android      compileSdkVersion 29     defaultConfig          targetSdkVersion 29          ...  ```  
This will tell Android Studio to compile your app with the Android 10 SDK and target Android 10 devices. You can also use lower values for `targetSdkVersion`, but you might not be able to use some of the new features and APIs in Android 10.
 
## Test Your App on Android 10
 
To test your app on Android 10 devices or emulators, you need to run your app from Android Studio. You can either connect a physical device that runs Android 10 or create a virtual device using the Android Emulator.
 
To create a virtual device, follow these steps:

1. Click **Tools** > **AVD Manager**.
2. Click **Create Virtual Device**.
3. Select a device model from the list or create a custom one.
4. Select an image that has **API Level 29**. If you don't have one, click **Download** next to it.
5. Click **Next**.
6. Edit the device settings if needed and click **Finish**.

To run your app on a device or emulator, follow these steps:

1. Select a device or emulator from the drop-down menu next to the **Run** button.
2. Click the **Run** button or press `Shift + F 8cf37b1e13
