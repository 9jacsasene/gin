If you are wondering what TopoShaper is and why you need it, let me explain. TopoShaper is another extension by Fredo6 that allows you to create terrains from contours. It is a powerful tool that can generate smooth and organic shapes from 2D curves. You can use it to model landscapes, hills, mountains, valleys, and more.
 
TopoShaper has many features that make it easy and fun to use. For example, you can edit the altitude of each contour point with a simple click and drag. You can also adjust the smoothness and resolution of the terrain with sliders. You can preview the terrain in 3D as you work on it. And you can export the terrain as a mesh or a group of faces.
 
TopoShaper is compatible with SketchUp 8 and higher, both free and pro versions. However, it requires LibFredo6 5.4b or higher to work properly. That's why you need to download and install LibFredo6 5.4b before using TopoShaper.
